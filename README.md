This data package contains data on the effects of prey availability on Sarracenia physiology at Harvard Forest in 2005. The study investigated the allometric relationships of carnivorous plants under nutrient-limited and nutrient-rich conditions. The dataset includes information on photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, foliar nutrient and chlorophyll content, and other physiological parameters of ten pitcher plant (Sarracenia) species.

Title: Effects of Prey Availability on Sarracenia Physiology at Harvard Forest 2005

Time period

Begin: 2005

End: 2005

Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the physiological responses of carnivorous plants (Sarracenia) to prey availability. The research examined the effects of increased prey availability on photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, foliar nutrient, and chlorophyll content of ten pitcher plant species. The experiment provided insights into the nutrient stoichiometry and allometry in carnivorous plants under varying nutrient conditions.

Data and file overview

.gitignore: Used in Git version control to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git and exclude them from being staged or committed.

.Rdata: Used by the R programming language and is typically created when saving the workspace or specific objects in an R session.

.Rhistory: A temporary file that is automatically updated as you work in the R console and records the history of commands entered in an R session.

Data Availability and Access

The data for this project can be accessed through the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) data portal. Detailed methodological information and specific data documentation can be found on the relevant page within the EDI data portal.

Methodological information

The feeding experiment followed a controlled approach to examine the effects of prey availability on Sarracenia physiology. Photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, and foliar nutrient and chlorophyll content were measured for ten pitcher plant species. The study used realistic prey treatments and measured physiological parameters directly to understand nutrient stoichiometry and allometry in carnivorous plants.
